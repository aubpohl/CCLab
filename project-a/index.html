                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Rafflesiaceae, Rafflesia genus — the "Human Flower" is a unique species among the variety of Rafflesia flowers, boasting features asimilar to its flowers of the same family. It does not contain multiple white spores across its surface; instead, when in full bloom, the entire flower turns a green-ish/blue-ish. Circumstances as to why these colors appear amidst bloom is unknown.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>This variety was specifically discovered in the Malay Peninsula of Thailand; it shares a similar habitat to other species within its family, inhabiting rainforest floors.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The "Human Flower" is reminiscient of the other Rafflesia flowers, large in length and width, lacking the spores of other flowers within the Rafflesiaceae family. Unlike the other Rafflesia flowers, the Rafflesia glorie is quick to react to human interaction, and much more sensitive to touch than other Rafflesia flowers. Instructions on ideal interaction with this species is detailed below.</p>

                The Rafflesia glorie ("Human Flower") is a rare, parasitic plant found in the tropical forests of east
                and southeast Asia (in 2020), lacking stems, roots, and any photosynthetic tissue. The Human Flower is
                iconically recognized by researchers as the only flower in the world to possess a "human-like consciousness,"
                with the ability to use two of five human senses (smell and hearing). In 2025, further discoveries
                found that the Human Flower may also be able to react to touch, and have advised careful interaction to
                scientists encountering the flower in the wild, as to not harm it.
                <br><br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span> The Human Flower is
                especially sensitive to touch. Being too harsh and hasty with the flower will cause it to quickly wither
                and die — limited interaction with the flower is allowed, for this reason. However, researchers have also
                found that gentle touch to the flower can induce positive results, with the Human Flower capable of blooming
                within seconds.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, the Human Flower is sensitive to smell and hearing. It is not known to grow beside other flowers
                of the Rafflesia genus due to their corpse-like scent, and is also known to wither away at unpleasant, sudden
                noises.
